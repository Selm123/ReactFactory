# ReactFactory guide:

## Purpose: create new React app in 1 second after first run, reduce time by 99%!

1. *** Please run first_run.rb at beginning!!! ***

2. After that, every time you want to create a new React app, just run react_factory.rb and input the app name, after 1s everything is settled and your server will be up for running!

Note: All new apps are under Project folder (created after first run)
