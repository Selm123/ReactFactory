# ReactFactory guide:

## Create new React app in 1 second after first run, reduce time by 99%!

1. *** Please run first_run.rb at beginning!!! ***

2. After first run, every time you want to create a new React app, just run *** react_factory.rb *** and input the app name, after 1s everything is settled and your server will be up for running!

Note: 
* All new apps are under Project folder (created after first run)
* Use control + c to end server after run react_factory.rb


## Future iterations
1. More than 1 projects could run in several ports
2. Hide node_modules folder
3. Add time stamp (date) as sub folder name, group apps by date folder
4. Easily add new component
